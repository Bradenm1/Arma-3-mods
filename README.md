# Evannex Gamemode
---
Arma 3 - AI vs AI Gamemode. Zones are randomly generated around the map you need to capture these zones by completing objectives and killing the AI within the zone. This game mode does not require any players input. AI will command themselves leaving players to do without having to micro manage the AI.

Note: This is my first ArmA 3 mod. This gamemode is also based off Invade & Annex and is very similar. I did not use their framework or code because I wanted to learn the SQF language and thought it would be fun to make my own version. This is why it does not include the same things.
